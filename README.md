C++ software for windows and linux to fetch and save the specifications the of the running machine and save it for later consultation

This application came from the need i have for a tool that grabs the information of the running machine, stores it and allow later consultation.
Even tho i am never wanted to become a TI support guy, somehow i ended up becoming one for my family, friends e work collegues and now i have under my supervision around 20 machines and often people came to me asking "can i upgrade my ram?", "can i upgrade my gpu?".
With this application, i want to be able to respond these questions quicker, maybe even remotely.
I am a junior software developer, leading to a full-stack career.
This is my first code almost all made by myself.
I have some help from gpt and alikes to solve some problems, but the code is still rough.
The development of this code will mirror the development of my programming habilities.
